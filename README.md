# Near-Core
### E-Amusement Server for Sound Voltex 6 written in Node.js.

## Why?

 - Because the only other alternative is `A******a`, some chinese closed-source software.
 - Because `A******a` has a 16 player limitation that cannot be easily removed.
 - ~~Because `A******a` does not support `Sound Voltex Exceed Gear` out of the box.~~ It does now.
 - Because I wanted to understand how Sound Voltex works inside.
 - Because it's fun.

## Pre-requisites

 - Node.js. Get the lastest version from [their website](https://nodejs.org/), or use your package manager.

## Installation

As there is no proprer realease yet, you will have to clone from the `master` branch for now.

You can install Near-core using this command in your terminal.

`git clone https://github.com/Xn2/Near-core.git && cd Near-core && npm i`

## Running Near-core

Use `node index.js` to start the server. It will create a new SQLite database automaticaly.

Change the **Service URL** of Sound Voltex to `http://localhost:5773/core` and start the game.

Voil√†!
